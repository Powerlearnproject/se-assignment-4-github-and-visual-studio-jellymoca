**Question 3: Explain the concept of version control in the context of Git. How does GitHub enhance version control for developers?**

**Version Control in Git**

Version control is a system that manages changes to a project over time. Git is a popular distributed version control system that tracks changes in source code during software development. It allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously without overwriting each other's changes.

Key Concepts in Git:
1. Repository (Repo): A repository is a storage space where the project's files and their revision history are kept. Repos can be local (on your computer) or remote (on a server).
1. Commit: A commit is a snapshot of the project's files at a specific point in time. Each commit has a unique ID (SHA) and includes a message describing the changes made.
1. Branch: A branch is a parallel version of the repository. Developers can create branches to work on new features, bug fixes, or experiments independently from the main codebase (usually the master or main branch).
1. Merge: Merging is the process of integrating changes from one branch into another. Git handles merge conflicts if changes clash.
1. Pull: Pulling is fetching changes from a remote repository and merging them into your local repository.
1. Push: Pushing sends your local changes to a remote repository, making them available to other collaborators.

How GitHub Enhances Version Control
1. GitHub builds on Git's core functionalities and adds a layer of tools and features that enhance collaboration and project management:
Remote Repositories: GitHub hosts remote repositories, making it easy to share your code with others. It also provides backup and access control.
1. Pull Requests (PRs): Pull requests are a feature unique to platforms like GitHub. They facilitate code review and discussion. Developers can comment on specific lines, suggest changes, and approve updates before merging them into the main branch.
Issue Tracking: GitHub offers an issue tracker to report bugs, request features, and manage tasks. Issues can be linked to commits and pull requests, providing context and traceability.
1. Branch Management: GitHub provides a visual interface to create, manage, and compare branches, making it easier to handle multiple development lines.
1. Collaboration Tools: Features like project boards, wikis, and team management enhance collaboration by providing a structured workflow and documentation.
1. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): GitHub integrates with various CI/CD tools to automate testing and deployment, ensuring that code changes do not break the project.

GitHub Actions are configured using YAML files called workflow files. These files define a series of steps to be executed when specific events occur. Workflows can range from simple tasks like running tests on each commit to complex CI/CD pipelines involving multiple stages of testing and deployment.

Example of a Simple CI/CD Pipeline using GitHub Actions
Scenario:
Automatically run tests and deploy a static website to GitHub Pages whenever changes are pushed to the main branch.

Step-by-Step Example:
Create a Workflow File
Create a .github/workflows/main.yml file in your repository with the following content:

![Actions](../se-assignment-4-github-and-visual-studio-jellymoca/act.png)

Explanation:
name: Specifies the name of the workflow.
on: Defines the trigger event. In this case, the workflow runs on push events to the main branch.
jobs: Contains one job named build.
runs-on: Specifies the operating system for the job (here, ubuntu-latest).
steps: Contains a sequence of steps to execute within the job.
actions/checkout@v2: Checks out your repository's code.
Dependency installation, testing, building, and deployment steps are performed sequentially.

Example Workflow Run:
Push to main Branch: Developer pushes changes to the main branch.
GitHub Actions Triggered: GitHub detects the push event and starts the defined workflow (CI/CD Pipeline).
Steps Executed:
Code is checked out.
Dependencies are installed.
